# Networking Projects

This repository contains a collection of **labs**, **projects**, and **config files** that demonstrate my hands-on skills and understanding of core networking concepts.

Each folder represents a specific lab or project focused on topics such as routing, switching, VLANs, subnetting, network security, and more. These are built using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **GNS3**, and **Wireshark**.
